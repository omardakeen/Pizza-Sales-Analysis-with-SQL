# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL 
In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze a pizza sales dataset and extract key business insights. The analysis focused on sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and product trends. Key metrics computed include:

Total Revenue: Sum of all sales to evaluate overall financial performance.

Average Order Value: Revenue divided by total orders to understand customer spending.

Total Pizzas Sold and Total Orders: Volume metrics to assess demand.

Average Pizzas Per Order: Insights into customer order habits.

Daily and Hourly Order Trends: Time-based analysis to identify peak business periods.

Sales Distribution by Pizza Category and Size: Percentage breakdown to understand product performance.

Total Pizzas Sold by Category: Volume sold per pizza category.

Bottom 5 Best Sellers: Identifying underperforming pizzas by quantity sold.

This analysis supports data-driven decision-making in areas like inventory planning, menu optimization, and marketing strategy.
